* Ticks

A repository based on uu.micros with experiments in demomaking patterns.

The idea is that each self-contained example might serve both a
documentation and educational need, as well as providing a reference
for anyone looking to solve audio/visual problems.

* How to contribute

You can submit pull requests or send patches directly. Every
improvement is welcome.

* After cloning this repository from Git, do

#+begin_src
   $ ./post-clone.sh
#+end_src

To run the examples (there are more than one)

#+begin_src sh
    $ ./draw-on-quad-with-shader.sh
    $ ./draw-image-on-screen.sh
    $ ./play-house-drum-pattern.sh
    $ ./render-debug-string.sh
#+end_src

The general pattern being for an example named <example-name>, with its corresponding source code at =./src/<example-name>=

#+begin_src
    $ ./<example-name>.sh
#+end_src

* Runtime
